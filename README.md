# Conways' Game of Life Visualisation in PyGame
==============

Callum Ke

This is a visualization of Conway's Game of Life which is a basic cellular automata implemented in PyGame.

How to Run
------------
To run the program you will need to have the PyGame module.

	python gameOfLife.py

How to Play
------------
  The program will always include alive cells at coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (4,4).
  This allows you to see a basic evolutionary pattern of the cells and the process of evolutionary stagnation which is when
  the cells stop evolving/changing state.
  
  You can continuously press SPACE to add additional random cells to see change the course of the cellular evolution.
  
  To QUIT you can either press ESC or the red cross.
